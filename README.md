# Learning-Log
A web-project where I consolidate the new knowledge about Spring Framework.
I took the basic idea of the project from the book "Python Crash Source by Eric Matthes"
and added a lot of my own features (like deleting entries, deleting and editing topics,
the ability to upload files (images) to the server and show them, also the ability
to remove the files from the sever, counting the number of entries of a particular topic,
showing how long ago was created a certain topic, ...).

This project is no longer supported or is "frozen" for a while because I'm going
move on to another project.
